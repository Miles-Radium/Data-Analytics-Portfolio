# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project - Cyclistic Project

Welcome to my project repository.

This is my analysis for the Cyclistic case study project, as part of the Google Data Analytics Certification program. My presentation PPTX, the relevant RNotebook as well as the document explaing the project have been made available for demonstration purposes. The RNotebook details the hands-on process I used to collect, clean, transform, visualize and derive insights from the data. Those insights are in easy-to-share presentation form in the powerpoint file. There I answer the executive's key business questions that would ultimately effect the business's direction and success.

The data used in the analysis has been kindly provided by Motivate International Inc. [under this license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). I do not own this data.
